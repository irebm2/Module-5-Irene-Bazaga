## Overview

The Password Generator is a web application coded with love and JavaScript by Irene Bazaga. It is designed to generate strong and secure passwords for you. It allows you to determine the length and type of the characters in your password, providing you with a unique and safe password each time you use it.

## Description

The Password Generator is an easy-to-use tool which, upon clicking the 'Generate Password' button, prompts the user with a series of options to customize their password. 

The password customizations available to the user include:

- Password length: The user is asked to select a password length between 8 to 128 characters.
- Character type: The user is prompted to include/exclude each of the following character types in their password:
  - Numerical characters
  - Lower case characters
  - Upper case characters
  - Special characters

The password is then generated with a secure random combination of the selected character types, and presented to the user in a text box.

The underlying code uses JavaScript to create arrays of each character type (numericals, lower case, upper case, special characters), and follows the user's preferences to generate a password. The implementation ensures that at least one of each selected character type is included in the final password.
